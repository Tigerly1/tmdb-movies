# TMDB MOVIES TASK

- Show top 500 movies in TMDB;
- Display for each movie: image, title, current rating, year;
- Each of the movies should link to the TMDB listing;
- You should be able to sort in order (ASC / DESC)
- You will use whatever styling you think is best. No design provided, however, you must make sure it looks good in desktop and mobile.
 - Each of the movies needs a “star” icon. Once clicked, it should highlight (change the background color) of the entire row. Re-clicking the star should de-highlight the row back to original state. This setting should persist (cookie/local storage).
